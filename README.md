# Singular Value Decomposition
Repository for Singular Value Decomposition project in Linear Algebra in Data Analysis course 2023, a part of Data Science Engineering Programme at Warsaw University of Technology.

The repository consists of the following files:

## 1. Theory PDF File
- Theoretical background and explanation of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method.

## 2. Python Implementation of SVD Decomposition
- Python code file implementing the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm.
- The code provides a custom implementation of SVD without using the built-in `np.linalg.svd()` function from NumPy.

## Used Technologies

The implementation and the accompanying PDF file utilize the following technologies:

- **NumPy**: The Python library for numerical computing.
  - Specifically, the `linalg` module from NumPy is used for certain linear algebra operations in the SVD implementation.

- **LaTeX**: A typesetting system used for document preparation.
  - LaTeX is used to create the PDF file containing the theoretical explanation of SVD.
  - Note: the LaTeX code is not available in the repository.
